            Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.[21] They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, 
            motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova.[22] These fuse to form zygotes,[23] 
            which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location,
             attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge.[24] In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement.
            [25] It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm 
            and an internal endoderm.[26] In most cases, a third germ layer,
             the mesoderm, also develops between them.[27] These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.[28]
